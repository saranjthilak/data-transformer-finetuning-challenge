# Data Transformer Fine-Tuning Challenge 🚀

This project is a part of a fine-tuning challenge focused on training transformer-based models for structured tabular data. It aims to explore the effectiveness of adapting transformer architectures—commonly used in NLP—for supervised learning tasks on structured datasets.

## 📌 Project Goals

- Fine-tune a data transformer model on structured/tabular datasets.
- Evaluate model performance using classification or regression metrics.
- Explore the benefits and limitations of transformer-based models vs traditional ML models (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest).
- Implement best practices for training and experimentation using PyTorch or Hugging Face Transformers.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- How transformer architectures can be adapted for tabular data.
- Fine-tuning and evaluation workflows.
- Dataset preprocessing, model architecture tuning, and metric-based evaluation.
- Experiment tracking and reproducibility.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas / NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Hugging Face Transformers (optional)
- Jupyter Notebooks
